Current work as of 3/4/20

VLD_FilterVCF is essentially complete, tested on CWL Rabix, though not yet tested on CWL Cromwell
Work direcoty katmai:/home/mwyczalk_test/Projects/GermlineCaller/VLD_FilterVCF

Results of VLD_FilterVCF are in the directory,
    /home/mwyczalk_test/Projects/GermlineCaller/C3L-00001/VLD_FilterVCF.out

Next, continue developing merge step: katmai:/home/mwyczalk_test/Projects/GermlineCaller/MergeFilterVCF
-> use above data as input for testing

Right now there are two scripts:
 * merge_vcf.sh - takes 5 VCFs + reference, combines into one VCF
 * run_merge_filter.sh - takes VCF and in/exclude lists, and retains calls based on INFO field "set"
   - terrible name.  Rename to "run_filter.sh"

-> need to have one script which does both.
  - do not pipe, since not big files and want to keep intermediate around
  - will need a dry stack
  - merge_and_filter.sh

-> continue implementation on shiso
